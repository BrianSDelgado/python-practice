# python-practice

This repository is my practice space for learning Python the way a Software Engineer uses it.

## What's here?

- **main.py** – simple script to test my Python + Git setup.
- Upcoming:
  - Data Structures & Algorithms practice (arrays, strings, hash maps, etc.)
  - Small Python projects and utilities.

## How to run

1. Create and activate the virtual environment (already done on my machine):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
